# Proposal of building a dashboard about world energy 
- author: DSCI 532 group 23

### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: International Energy Agency

Target audience: World leaders and the public

Energy use and consumption are related to health and the environment.
Excessive energy consumption will cause air pollution, global warming,
destruction of ecosystems, and human health damage. In response to this
challenge, we propose building a data visualization dashboard that
allows world leaders and the public to visually discover a
world energy dataset. We appeal to the public to save energy
consumption. Our dashboard will show a world map’s heatmap, which allows
colour to change by the significant category selected. Our dashboard
will also offer one or two other secondary charts that change over time.

### Section 2: Description of the data

We will visualize a tidy world energy dataset of 56706 observations. This
dataset initially comes from an untidy version of the world energy
dataset. After cleaning the data, we will have four columns, which are
year, energy type (energy_type), country code (country_code), and
energy consumption (energy). The year column contains different types of
energy that were used by time from 1980 to 2018. The energy type
(energy_type) column contains different kinds of energy such as coal,
natural gas, petroleum and other liquids and so on. The country code
column contains different countries’ code names. The energy consumption
(energy) column contains the consumption amounts of different types of
energy. Moreover, units (quad Btu) for all energy consumption are the
same.
